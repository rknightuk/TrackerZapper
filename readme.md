[Website and more info](https://rknight.me/apps/tracker-zapper)

TrackerZapper is a Mac app that sits in your menubar and automatically removes tracking parameters from any links you copy.

[Download from the releases page](https://github.com/rknightuk/TrackerZapper/releases/latest)

You can also install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install --cask trackerzapper
```

You will get a warning about unidentified developer so you can either right-click > open, or attempt to open then open System Preferences > Security & Privacy then allow the app.

Requires MacOS Big Sur or later because I don't have anything else to test on. It might work, give it a go.
